Assignment 1

Print the value of my_amount without changing it, but only display two decimal places.
The correct output should be 25.68

Then print the next three variables (my_first_number, my_second_number, and 
my_third_number) so that they also only show two decimal places and so that they are 
right-aligned in a column with a width of six characters. The output should look like:
124.54
 51.49
  6.28
"""



my_amount = 25.678437
print "%.2f" % my_amount  # fix this line to display only two decimal places of my_amount


my_first_number = 124.5392
my_second_number = 51.493333
my_third_number = 6.28345


# right-align the above three floating point values in a column with a width of 6 
# characters and show only two decimal places

print "%6.2f" % my_first_number
print "%6.2f" % my_second_number
print "%6.2f" % my_third_number
